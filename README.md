# Introduction to Digital Humanities - individual part
This is the individual part of [this project](https://github.com/petar-soldo/IDH2025-G5). The goal is to perform topic analysis on book titles across different languages.

The main file in this repository is [the Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/petar-soldo/IDH25-individual/blob/main/IDH-individual.ipynb) which contains commented code used to extract data and perform the analysis.
